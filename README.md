Certainly! Here's a refined version of your description:

NoteMaker is a powerful note-making website built using the MERN stack. Users can create notes with a title, description, and tags. The description field includes rich text features such as adding bullet points, bold, italics, underlining, converting text to uppercase or lowercase, and removing extra spaces.

Users can sign up and log in, with each user's notes stored separately for privacy. Additionally, users can sort notes by date and search for notes by tags.

To manually run your React web application through VS Code when the GitHub repository contains both client and server folders, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
1. Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.
2. Git: Ensure that Git is installed on your system. You can download it from git-scm.com.

Step-by-Step Process

1. Clone the Repository
-Open VS Code.
-Open the terminal in VS Code by navigating to View > Terminal or by pressing `Ctrl + ``.
-Clone your GitHub repository by running the following command in the terminal: git clone <your-repo-url>
-Replace <your-repo-url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
-After cloning, navigate into the project folder using: cd <your-project-folder-name>

3. Install Dependencies
You need to install the dependencies for both the client and server folders.

For the Server:

-Navigate to the server folder: cd server
-Install the dependencies using npm or yarn: npm install
-Or, if you're using yarn: yarn install

For the Client:

-Open a new terminal or return to the root directory and navigate to the client folder: cd ../client
-Install the dependencies: npm install
-Or: yarn install

4. Run the Server
-After installing the dependencies, start the server by navigating back to the server directory if you're not already there: cd ../server
-Run the server: npm start
-Or, if you are using nodemon for auto-restarts: npx nodemon
-The server should now be running on the specified port (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

5. Run the Client
-Open a new terminal in VS Code or navigate back to the client directory in your existing terminal: cd ../client
-Start the React application: npm start
-The React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 by default.

6. View the Application
-Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the React frontend.
-The frontend will make API requests to the backend server running on http://localhost:5000.
