Certainly! Here's a refined version of your description:

NoteMaker is a powerful note-making website built using the MERN stack. Users can create notes with a title, description, and tags. The description field includes rich text features such as adding bullet points, bold, italics, underlining, converting text to uppercase or lowercase, and removing extra spaces.

Users can sign up and log in, with each user's notes stored separately for privacy. Additionally, users can sort notes by date and search for notes by tags.
